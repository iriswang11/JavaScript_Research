			<h2>Purpose</h2>
			<p>AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly. </p>
			<p>AngularJS's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write. Angular JS is a toolset for building framework best suited to your application. Angular JS is widely used for Single Page applications.</p>

			<h3>Pros:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>It is fully extensible and works well with other libraries.</li>
				<li>Every feature can be modified or replaced to suit your unique development workflow and feature needs.</li>
				<li>Code production is comparatively fast.</li>
				<li>Every piece of application was easily testable.</li>
				<li>Two way binding, which means changes in the backend are immediately reflected on the UI.</li>
				<li>Angular JS improves server performance. It means that the server performs extremely well thanks to reduced traffic and because it only serves static fields and responds to the API calls.</li>
				<li>Angular JS is highly testable. By allowing unit testing and end-to- end testing, it makes testing and debugging much simpler than you can imagine.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Cons:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Possible time consumption</li>
				<li>Difficult learning</li>
				<li>JavaScript is mandatory</li>
			</ul>
