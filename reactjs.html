			<h2>Purpose</h2>
			<p>React.js is an open-source JavaScript library with the JS functions that produces HTML and CSS codes. With a few basic functions, developers can easily create intuitive UI for websites and mobile applications.</p>
			<p>React contains the set of codes and conditional statements using virtual DOM manipulation making data rendering much faster than other frameworks. One-way data binding is another feature of React stabalizing the code and giving developers the ease to control data.</p>

			<h3>Pros:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>React JS uses virtual DOM that makes the user experience better. It also makes the developer’s job less complex.</li>
				<li>JSX is used in React JS which is very simple and easy to learn. </li>
				<li>There is no need for separate files for logic and markup in React JS.</li>
				<li>React JS is an open-source library that is maintained by Facebook. It is a constantly developing library.</li>
				<li>React JS also provides a mobile solution that is known as React Native.</li>
				<li>React JS is faster for rendering as compared to other web frameworks.</li>
				<li>It is SEO friendly.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Cons:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>It needs additional libraries for routing, state management, and API interaction.</li>
				<li>React JS is a large size library.</li>
				<li>React JS only covers the UI part, nothing else.</li>
			</ul>

Once you’re done with it, you will have all the bits of knowledge required to advance into more complex applications.</p>

			<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>
			<p><strong>The Beginner’s Guide to React:</strong>is a free video course created by Kent C. Dodds for Egghead that you can binge watch in 3 hour. It’s broken down in bite sized pieces of 2 to 8 minutes covering the core elements of React and gradually diving deep into more complex topics. </p>

			<p><strong>Learn React for Free:</strong> is a set of web cource on Scrimba. They provide an interactive system that allows you to change the instructor’s code on the fly during the explanation and experiment with the topic explained. This is a really great method of teaching since most of the time you will also want to play around with the code and see how it works. You also don’t have to worry about breaking anything once you’ve continued to play the video.</p>
